<!-- Describe your project in brief -->

<!-- The best dimensions for the banner is **1280x650px**. You could also use this for social preview of your repo.

I use [**Shields IO**](https://shields.io/) for making badges. It is a simple and easy to use tool that you can use for almost all your badge cravings. -->

<!-- Some badges that you could use -->

<!-- ![GitHub release (latest by date including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/navendu-pottekkat/awesome-readme?include_prereleases)
: This badge shows the version of the current release.

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/navendu-pottekkat/awesome-readme)
: I think it is self-explanatory. This gives people an idea about how the project is being maintained.

![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/navendu-pottekkat/awesome-readme)
: This is a dynamic badge from [**Shields IO**](https://shields.io/) that tracks issues in your project and gets updated automatically. It gives the user an idea about the issues and they can just click the badge to view the issues.

![GitHub pull requests](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-pr/navendu-pottekkat/awesome-readme)
: This is also a dynamic badge that tracks pull requests. This notifies the maintainers of the project when a new pull request comes.

![GitHub All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/navendu-pottekkat/awesome-readme/total): If you are not like me and your project gets a lot of downloads(*I envy you*) then you should have a badge that shows the number of downloads! This lets others know how **Awesome** your project is and is worth contributing to.

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/navendu-pottekkat/awesome-readme)
: This shows what kind of open-source license your project uses. This is good idea as it lets people know how they can use your project for themselves.

![Tweet](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url?style=flat-square&logo=twitter&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnavendu.me%2Fnsfw-filter%2Findex.html): This is not essential but it is a cool way to let others know about your project! Clicking this button automatically opens twitter and writes a tweet about your project and link to it. All the user has to do is to click tweet. Isn't that neat? -->

# Installation
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!--The first one should be how to install(how to generally use your project or set-up for editing in their machine).

This should give the users a concrete idea with instructions on how they can use your project repo with all the steps.

Following this steps, **they should be able to run this in their device.**

A method I use is after completing the README, I go through the instructions from scratch and check if it is working. -->

To use this project, first clone the repo on your device using the command below:

```bash
git init
git clone https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter.git
```

# Usage
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!-- This is optional and it is used to give the user info on how to use the project after installation. This could be added in the Installation section also. -->

# Development
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!-- This is the place where you give instructions to developers on how to modify the code.

You could give **instructions in depth** of **how the code works** and how everything is put together.

You could also give specific instructions to how they can setup their development environment.

Ideally, you should keep the README simple. If you need to add more complex explanations, use a wiki. Check out [this wiki](https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter/wiki) for inspiration. -->

# License
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!-- Adding the license to README is a good practice so that people can easily refer to it.

Make sure you have added a LICENSE file in your project folder. **Shortcut:** Click add new file in your root of your repo in GitHub > Set file name to LICENSE > GitHub shows LICENSE templates > Choose the one that best suits your project!

I personally add the name of the license and provide a link to it like below. -->

[GNU General Public License version 3](https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0)

# Footer
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!-- Let's also add a footer because I love footers and also you **can** use this to convey important info.

Let's make it an image because by now you have realised that multimedia in images == cool(*please notice the subtle programming joke). -->

Leave a star in GitHub, give a clap in Medium and share this guide if you found this helpful.

<!-- Add the footer here -->
